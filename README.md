# Introduction

In this experiment, I performed an Exploratory Data Analysis of the dataset for a selected group of customers in the initial days of post-sale. 

# Objectives

Here are the questions I would like to answer: 

    Is there a correlation between the Score and repayment performance?

    Is there a correlation between the Score and delinquency status?

    Are there other interesting insights you can glean from the dataset provided?
